The code files are split into different parts, first, you should run the collector and cordinates files in order to obtain the pictures
from google api and sort them into their respective country folder, this process takes time so we have provided a download link to the datasets
we used in this project, so before running the experiments codes, you should download the datasets and move them into the  code_files folder.

Datasets: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fwl6rypEN0v5s-Frop2DXHMW4P4lhxJG/view?usp=sharing
the folder dataset contains 30 countries, and for each country 1000 pictures.
the folder augmented_dataset contains 30 countries, and for each country 1000 pictures and additional 1000 flipped pictures of the original thousand (2000 each).

After that, in order to run the experiments, each file of them is independant of the other files, therefore, running the codes is straight forward,
the code is split into blocks in the notebook, where each block does a specific task (one for training, one for testing etc.), so simply run
each block and check the results.
